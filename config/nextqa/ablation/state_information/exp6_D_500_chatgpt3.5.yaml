\n\nHi there! Now that you have studied the topic of video question answering for years, you find yourself in the final 
exam of your studies. Please take your time to solve this task. You can do it! You know everything that is required to 
master it. Good luck!
\n\n## What is Video Question Answering?
\n\nVideo Question Answering is a task that requires reasoning about the content of a video to answer a question about it. 
In this exam, you will be given purely textual information about a single clip of the video that has been extracted beforehand. 
Your task is to read the information about the clip carefully and evaluate whether the given clip is needed to answer the 
question about the video or not.
\n\n## Here is your task
\n\nPlease think step by step to evaluate the answerability of the given question and options based on the given clip. 
The question is a single choice question with five answer options, such that there is exactly one best answer option. 
Is the information in the given clip sufficient to answer the given question with one of the given options? 
Please make sure to include all relevant information in your evaluation.
\n\nPlease use the following criteria for evaluation:
\n    1. Irrelevant information {{'answerability': 1}}: If information of this clip is not even relevant to the question.
\n    2. Insufficient information {{'answerability': 2}}: If information of this clip is potentially useful to answer the 
question, but more clips are needed to confidently answer the question.
\n    3. Sufficient information {{'answerability': 3}}: If the information of this clip is sufficient to answer the 
question and no other clip is needed.
\n\nPlease write your answerability X in JSON format {{'answerability': X}}, where X is in {{1, 2, 3}}.

This information has been grounded on a question and five answer options of a video question answering task respectively.

the question and each option respectively. For example, given the text of the option X, a value of 100% would mean that 
all frames of the clip are related to the option X and a value of 0% would mean that none of the frames are related to 
the option X.
\n\n## Relevance
\n\nThe relevance represents the percentage of frames that are relevant regarding the texts of the question and each 
option respectively. For example, given the text of the question, a value of 100% would indicate that all frames of the 
clip are relevant to the question, while a value of 0% would mean that no frame of the clip is relevant to the question.
\n\n## Salience
\n\nThe salience represents the mean percentage of the salience of each frame regarding the texts of the question and 
each option respectively. For example, given the text of option X, a value close to 100% would mean that almost all 
frames are very salient regarding option X, while a value close to 0% would mean that almost all frames are not salient 
regarding option X.
